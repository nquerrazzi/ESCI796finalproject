    "Introduction:\n",
    "    With climate change's impacts growing more prevalent each year, we must learn to use historical changes in our environment to prepare us for what the future may look like. This script analyzes any changes in both the temperature and the snowfall on Mt. Washington in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The script will also look for any correlation between possible rising temperatures and a change in snowfall. The White Mountains are a popular winter destination for winter sport enthusiasts. If winters are becoming warmer and getting less snow, will it bring less tourists and therefore less money into the area? We must understand the trends in temperature and snowfall in order to protect our winters, if necessary. Not only does protecting our winters protect the economy and community in the White Mountains, but it also preserves the natural environment."

    "    The data being analyzed was recorded on Mt. Washington in New Hampshire. The measurements took place at an elevation of 6272' and started in 1948 until 2023. The elevation is a few thousand feet higher in elevation than most the surrounding ski mountains, although this data provided the most thorough and longest dataset. While there may be differences in amount of snowfall and temperature, the trends this analysis provides will be applicable to the surrounding White Mountains. "
